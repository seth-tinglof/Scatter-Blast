# Scatter-Blast
A 2D shoot 'em up game with color matching mechanics.

This Game was created in C using visual studio. It utalizes the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) libraries found at https://www.libsdl.org
for simple graphics. In order to compile this project yourself, you will have to link it with the SDL libriaries which I found easiest to
do with visual studio. A fairly comprehensive guide on how to do this can be found here (https://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-SDL-with-Visual-Studio-2017).
I wrote and compiled this project using windows 10, but in theory one should be able to compile an run the game on most operating systems 
as SDL provides fairly universal support.
